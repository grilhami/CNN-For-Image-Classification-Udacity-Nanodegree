# CNN-For-Image-Classification-Udacity-Nanodegree

The Second project of the Udacity Nanodegree is to build a Convolutional Neural Network for Image classification. Here I was able to 
classify images from the CIFAR-10 datset using a convolutional neural network.

# Dependencies:

- Numpy

- Tensorflow

- Floyd (from FloydHub for cloud computing)

# Wile working on this project, I was introduced to

# Tensorflow
TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It has one of the best documentation and 
great tutorials.

# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a type of internet-based computing. It provides shared computer resources and data to computers and other devices on 
demand. I used FloydHub and some Amazon Web Services for the project, but i encourage you to check Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

# Deep NeuraL Networks
I was able to learn how to got from a simple Feer Forward Nework to Deeo Neural Network and learn technques to prevent overfitting like 
Regularization and Dropouts.

# Convolutional Neural Network
Convolutional Neural Network is a type of Neural Network that helps us dramarically increase performance in image classification. There
are many kinds of CNN also such as VGGnet, GooGlenet (inception), etc.
